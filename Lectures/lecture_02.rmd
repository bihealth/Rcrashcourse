## Matrices and data frames

 Caveats:

  * data frames turn strings to factors, which may have really
    disastrous consequences, use `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`
  * small typos can turn a numeric vector into a string
  * factors are dangerous to work with, use them cautiously

  Gory details: matrices are a basic data type. Data frames are a list.


## Demonstration

## Excercise 2

 * Create a 5x3 matrix with random numbers. Use `matrix` and `rnorm`.
 * Turn the matrix into a data frame. Use `as.data.frame` for that.
 * Add column and row names.
 * Add a column. Each value in the column should be "A" (a string). Use the
   `rep` function for that.
 * Add a column with numbers 1 to 5. Use the `seq` function for that.
