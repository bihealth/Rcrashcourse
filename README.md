Bioinformatic R Crash Course

9-13 March at the CUBI / BIH

How to get there:

We are located above the Charite Mitte CCCC, which you can enter either
from Charite (Virchowweg 23) or from Invalidenstr. 80. You need to get to
level 3 (note that the slightly-above-ground level is level 1). There will
be no problem finding either the CUBI or the meeting room there. If you are
lost, e-mail me (january.weiner@bihealth.de)
